# Radiology-in-the-cloud
This year's instantiation of Radiology-In-The-Cloud moves the existing ChRIS architecture to a docker-based version.

Fundamentally, ChRIS (Children's Research Integration System) is a combination of web-based data storage front-end and a workflow manager that allows multiple possible configurations (such as cluster, remote, or local) for image processing back-ends (utilizing industry standard programs such as Freesurfer(http://freesurfer.net/)).  More information on the details of ChRIS are available at the site for Boston Children's Hospital's Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center, which has its own Git Repository (https://github.com/FNNDSC/).
